In this project, I improved my understanding of component structures by using props effectively. I practiced the use of useState to manage state and learned how to structure data flow efficiently in React.

I also deepened my knowledge of the spread operator and its practical use in handling state updates. Furthermore, I explored the use of map for rendering lists and filter to dynamically manage and update the list based on conditions.

By combining all these concepts, I successfully built a functional and interactive Todo List application.
